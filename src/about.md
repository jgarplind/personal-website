For starters, I like solving problems. I like collaborating. I enjoy
working as a front-end developer but it is really just one of many

## Side activities ‚öΩÔ∏è

### Board member of tenant owners' association</h3>

October 2019 - June 2020

Learning more about the inner workings of the community where I live
while making the community where I live a better place to live.

### Volunteering

Long background in volunteering, though currently no active recurring
engagements. I have been a Math Coach, General Tutor, Programming Tutor,
and a Swedish buddy for two boys who had just immigrated to Sweden.

### Sports

I enjoy sports a lot. Mostly football since it is easy to find people to
play with, but most sports, e-sports, chess,
and other similar activities catch my interest. So much that I have been
coaching/refereeing on several occassions, mostly football and
floorball. Most memorably, I co-coached an international football team
while i Korea, bringing 10+ nationalities together and travelling across
the country to play tournaments.

## Certificates and awards üèÜ

### Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)

As a [Web Accessibility Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification) I have a solid understanding of how to make the web accessible.

### Certified SAFe 4 Practitioner

I do think that SAFe does bring up a lot of good points, but I don't think
that a certificate says much of anything.

Agile to me is a mindset and a philosophy more so than a
cadence based work schedule, and I am happy to discuss it.

I do have a lot of knowledge about
working in agile environments from work experience on a daily basis since
graduation, but also from university projects, in particular
[one project-centered course](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDC88/index.en.shtml).

### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2018 Certified Associate Architect

I learned a lot when studying for the certificate as I
had to learn cloud concepts for the very first time. Furthermore, I can
now complement the theoretical knowledge with practical experience from
Azure which gives me a solid understanding of cloud architecture
independent of the vendor providing the services.

### Scholarship, Technology Doctor Erik Johnsson‚Äôs Fund

Received SEK 50¬†000 for pursuing exchange studies. Selection based on
previous grades.

### Scholarship, The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers</h3>

Received SEK 8 500 for pursuing exchange studies. Selection based on
previous grades.

## Languages üó£

- Swedish ‚Äì the language I dream in.
- English ‚Äì the language I work in.
- Spanish ‚Äì the language I learned in school but never applied.
- Korean ‚Äì the language I briefly learned and try not to forget.

## Personal ü§ì

Too many things to write in too little space! Right now I am enjoying
Civilization VI (computer game) because it has a good balance of
strategic elements, historical accuracy and engaging gameplay.
