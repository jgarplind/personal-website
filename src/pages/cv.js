      Exchange studies, Korean Advanced Institution of Science and Technology
    </h3>
    <p>
      During one year, I studied on one of the worlds leading engineering
      universities. Some interesting courses include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Databases</li>
      <li>Algorithms (Java programming)</li>

    <h3>Board member of tenant owners' association</h3>
    <p>October 2019 - present</p>
    <p>
      Learning more about the inner workings of the community where I live while
      making the community where I live a better place to live.
    </p>
    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
    <p>
      Long background in volunteering, though currently no active recurring
      engagements. I have been a Math Coach, General Tutor, Programming Tutor,
      and a Swedish buddy for two boys who had just immigrated to Sweden.
    </p>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy sports a lot. Mostly football since it is easy to find people to
      play with, but most sports, e-sports, chess (is not a sport, right?), and
      other similar activities catch my interest. So much that I have been
      coaching/refereeing on several occassions, mostly football and floorball.
      Most memorably, I co-coached an international football team while i Korea,
      bringing 10+ nationalities together and travelling across the (small)
      country to play tournaments.

      Certificates and awards{" "}
      <span role="img" aria-label="trophy">
        üèÜ
      </span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I don't value certificates highly, since I believe they only show a
      miniscule subset of the skills I and others possess. Still, they are
      verified merits, so here goes:
    </p>
    <h3>Certified SAFe 4 Practitioner</h3>
    <p>(read as: "I know agile")</p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I would argue that I do have a lot of knowledge about
      working in agile environments, both from school projects (in particular
      one project-centered course:
      <a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDC88/index.en.shtml">
        "Programvaruutveckling/PUMen"
      </a>
      ) but increasingly from work experience on a daily basis since graduation.
      Agile to me is a mindset and a philosophy more so than a cadence based
      work schedule, and I am happy to discuss it. Final note: I do think that
      SAFe does bring up a lot of good points, but I don't think that a
      certificate says much of anything.
    </p>
    <h3>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2018 Certified Associate Architect</h3>
    <p>(read as: "I know cloud")</p>
    <p>
      Sarcasm aside, I did learn a lot when studying for the certificate as I
      had to learn cloud concepts for the very first time. Furthermore, I can
      now complement the theoretical knowledge with practical experience from
      Azure which gives me a solid understanding of cloud architecture
      independent of the vendor providing the services.

      Too many things to write in too little space! Right now I am enjoying
      Civilization VI (computer game) because it has a good balance of strategic
      elements, historical accuracy and engaging gameplay.
