      just one of many domains in which I enjoy to solve problems.

    <h3>Board member of tenant owners' association</h3>
    <p>October 2019 - present</p>
    <p>
      Learning more about the inner workings of the community where I live while
      making the community where I live a better place to live. Live.
    </p>
    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
    <p>
      Long background in volunteering, though currently no active recurring
      engagements. I have been a Math Coach, General Tutor, Programming Tutor,
      and a Swedish buddy for two boys who had just immigrated to Sweden.
    </p>
    <h3>Sportsing</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy sportsing, a lot. Mostly football since it is easy to find people
      to play with, but most sports, e-sports, chess (is not a sport, right?),
      and other similar activities catch my interest. So much that I have been
      coaching/refereeing on several occassions, mostly football and floorball.
      Most memorably, I co-coached an international football team while i Korea,
      bringing 10+ nationalities together and travelling across the (small)
      country to play tournaments.

      Certificates and awards{" "}
      <span role="img" aria-label="trophy">
        üèÜ
      </span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I don't value certificates highly, since I believe they only show a
      miniscule subset of the skills I and others possess. But others think
      differently, so here goes:
    </p>
    <h3>Certified SAFe 4 Practitioner</h3>
    <p>(read as: "I know agile")</p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I would argue that I do have a lot of knowledge about
      working in agile environments, both from school projects (shoutout to
      "Programvaruutveckling/PUMen") but increasingly from work experience on a
      daily basis since graduation. Agile to me is a mindset and a philosophy
      more so than a cadence based work schedule, and I am happy to discuss it.
      Final note: I do think that SAFe does bring up a lot of good points, but I
      don't think that a certificate says much of anything.
    </p>
    <h3>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2018 Certified Associate Architect</h3>
    <p>(read as: "I know cloud")</p>
    <p>
      Sarcasm aside, I did learn a lot when studying for the certificate as I
      had to learn cloud concepts for the very first time. Furthermore, I can
      now complement the theoretical knowledge with practical experience from
      Azure which gives me a solid understanding of cloud architecture
      independent of the vendor providing the services.

      Too many things to write in too little space. Right now I am enjoying
      Civilization VI (computer game). Good balance of strategy, historical
      accuracy and plain good gameplay.
